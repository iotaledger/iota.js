# Getting Started With iota.js

<IotaRS/>

## Required Prior Knowledge

This wiki assumes that you already know the basics of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). If you are
unfamiliar with the language, you can find documentation to get started in the official
[TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).

If you have never programmed in your life, MIT has published an open
[introductory course to programming](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/)
which could help you get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using the library, you will need to install the following software:

* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/): You should use v15, or above.
* [npm](https://npmjs.com): You should use v7, or above.

## Install the Library

You can install the iota.js library using npm with a single command:

```bash
npm install @iota/iota.js@next
```

## Use the Library

Once you have [installed the library](#install-the-library), you can start using it by requiring the
[iota.js package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iota/iota.js) as shown in the following example which connects to a
Chrysalis node and logs some of its properties to the console.

```js
const {SingleNodeClient} = require("@iota/iota.js");

async function run() {
    const client = new SingleNodeClient("https://chrysalis-nodes.iota.org");

    const info = await client.info();
    console.log("Node Info");
    console.log("\tName:", info.name);
    console.log("\tVersion:", info.version);
    console.log("\tIs Healthy:", info.isHealthy);
    console.log("\tNetwork Id:", info.networkId);
    console.log("\tLatest Milestone Index:", info.latestMilestoneIndex);
    console.log("\tConfirmed Milestone Index:", info.confirmedMilestoneIndex);
    console.log("\tPruning Index:", info.pruningIndex);
    console.log("\tFeatures:", info.features);
    console.log("\tMin PoW Score:", info.minPowScore);
}

run()
    .then(() => console.log("Done"))
    .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```
