# Run Code Examples

1. Clone the project by running the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:iotaledger/iota.js.git
```

2. Change directory into the project by running the following command:

```bash
cd iota.js
```

3. Check out the [`feat/stardust`](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/tree/feat/stardust) branch by running the
following command:

```bash
git checkout feat/stardust
```

4. Install the packages dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

5. The Iota package examples make use of the other [packages](../getting_started#additional-packages) included in this
repository. You can run the following commands to set up all of them:

```bash
npm run dist-neon
npm run dist-all
```

5. Change the directory to the desired how-to.  For instance, the following command will change into the
[How To Create a Simple Connection](simple.mdx) article:

```bash
cd packages/iota/examples/simple/
```

6. You can now run the example by running the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```
