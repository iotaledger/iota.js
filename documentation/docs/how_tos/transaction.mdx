# Send a Transaction

<WalletTransactionRecomendation/>

## Pre-requirements

Before you can create a transaction, you will need to:

* [Connect to a Node](simple.mdx).
* [Generate a seed](address.mdx#generate-a-seed).
* [Create an address](address.mdx#create-an-address).
* [Create a wallet](#create-a-walllet).
* [Request funds](#request-funds).
* [Fetch basic outputs](#fetch-basic-outputs).

### Create a Wallet

#### Create a wallet seed

You can create a wallet seed by instantiating an [Ed25519Seed](../references/client/classes/Ed25519Seed) using its constructor.
You will need to provide `secretBytes` to the constructor, which you can get by using the [Converter.hexToBytes(hex)](../references/util/classes/Converter.md#hextobytes) function.

#### Retrieve the wallet's address

Once you have [created your wallet seed](#create-a-wallet-seed), you can use it

Once you have [generated a seed](#generate-a-seed), you can create a wallet using the [Ed25519Address.toAddress()](../references/client/classes/Ed25519Address.md#toaddress) fucntion.

### Request Funds

Before you can send the transaction, you will need to request funds.  If you are on the alphanet, you can request test
funds from the [faucet](https://faucet.alphanet.iotaledger.net/api/enqueue). If you are running a [private tangle](https://wiki.iota.org/hornet/how_tos/private_tangle),
you can use the '/enqueue' endpoint.

## Send the Transaction

Once you have fulfilled the [pre-requirements](#pre-requirements), you can send the transaction using either the [sendAdvanced(client, inputsAndSignatureKeyPairs, outputs, taggedData?)](../references/client/api_ref#sendadvanced) function, which will return the created block's id, or the [send(client, seed, accountIndex, addressBech32, amount, taggedData?, addressOptions?)](../references/client/api_ref.md#send) function, which will return the created block's id, as well as the constructed blocks.

As this example uses a genesis address, it must use the `(client, inputsAndSignatureKeyPairs, outputs, taggedData?)` function.  However, if you are doing a wallet to wallet transfer, you can use the `send(client, seed, accountIndex, addressBech32, amount, taggedData?, addressOptions?)` method.
