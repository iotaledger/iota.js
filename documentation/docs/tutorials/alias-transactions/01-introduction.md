# Stardust for iota.js: Alias Transactions

This tutorial will get you acquainted with the structure and functionality of [Alias Transactions](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/introduction/explanations/ledger/alias) in
IOTA's [Stardust protocol](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/introduction/welcome) in
the [Shimmer network](https://shimmer.network) using [iota.js](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js) primitives to
issue transactions that involve Alias Output.

## Introduction

Starting from [Chrysalis](https://wiki.iota.org/introduction/welcome), IOTA is
a [UTXO-based (Unspent Transaction Output)](https://wiki.iota.org/introduction/reference/details#unspent-transaction-output-utxo)
Ledger. Each UTXO, also known as  **output**, has an associated number of tokens that determines its value.
Thus, the permanent data on the ledger is composed of a set of records (*outputs*) that can be unlocked by the owner of
its associated address, i.e., the one who knows the address' private key.

There are different [output types](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/learn/outputs). This tutorial series will only focus on
**Alias Outputs** known as [`IAliasOutput`](./../../references/client/interfaces/IAliasOutput.md). Alias Outputs are
generated by transactions that unlock and consume already existing outputs. When a transaction consumes them, these
outputs turn into inputs and generate new outputs, typically another Alias Output with the same Alias ID but in a different state. At pruning time, *consumed outputs* will be removed by Nodes.

## Storage Costs and Deposits

You need to take into account that Alias Output as any other UTXOs need to be stored by [Hornet Nodes](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/hornet/welcome), so there is a [storage cost](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/iotajs/tutorials/value-transactions/introduction/#storage-costs-and-deposits).
