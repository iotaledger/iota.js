# Request Funds from the Testnet Faucet

Once you have [generated a set of addresses](04-generate-addresses.md), you will need some funds to experiment with
value
transactions.

Since this tutorial uses the [testnet](https://explorer.shimmer.network/testnet), you can request funds from
the [Shimmer testnet faucet](https://faucet.testnet.shimmer.network/).

In this example we are going to use `rms1qp5kej93urfvrc5lhuay7jgupjwuwvxxunzwp59tvqg7nufqntcpxp26uj8`
or `0x696cc8b1e0d2c1e29fbf3a4f491c0c9dc730c6e4c4e0d0ab6011e9f1209af013` in Ed25519 format.

Once you have entered your address and clicked `Request`, you can use
the [Shimmer Network Explorer](https://explorer.shimmer.network/testnet) to verify that the balance on your address is
now `1000 SMR` (the default quantity transferred by the Faucet). You can also analyze the information provided by the
Explorer:

* The `1000 SMR` corresponds to an output with a certain ID and timestamp.

* The output has been generated by a transaction signed by the faucet and which has a particular ID.

* A storage deposit is reported. It corresponds to `42600 Glow` which it is the vByte cost for the output associated
  with our initial address.
